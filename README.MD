This project was created using Meteor.js, so if you want it to run on your machine,
you need to have your meteor installed.
I have also implemented some packages as:
<ul>
	<li>accounts-password</li>
	<li>accounts-ui</li>
	<!-- For logning in -->
	<li>barbatus:stars-rating </li>
	<!-- for rating -->
	<li>iron:router</li>
	<!-- for routing different templates into pages -->
</ul>

The insecure package was removed, but autopublish is still on.
